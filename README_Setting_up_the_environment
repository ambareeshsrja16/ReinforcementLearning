Clone the following repo -> https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym -> and install the library as recommended.


First, you can perform a minimal installation of OpenAI Gym with

git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
pip install -e .
Then, the easiest way to install Pybullet-Gym is to clone the repository and install locally

git clone https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym.git
cd pybullet-gym
pip install -e .
Important Note: Do not use python setup.py install as this will not copy the assets (you might get missing SDF file errors).

Finally, to test installation, open python and run

import gym  # open ai gym
import pybulletgym  # register PyBullet enviroments with open ai gym

env = gym.make('HumanoidPyBulletEnv-v0')
env.reset()  # should return a state vector if everything worked
